# Developing Data Products - Course Project
======================================================================================================================
This is a submission for Coursera course: Developing Data Products

## NOAA's Data Explorer
======================================================================================================================
This application is based on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database.
Weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, this NOAA's dataset isa record of events from 1950 ot 2011 in all US states.

Dataset has been obtained from the Coursera Reproducible Research Course site [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). Data has been cleaned up. For clarity, events have been combined based on term similarity leading to 24 types of event from the initial 985 in the original database. Code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbassard/Developing-Data-Products) "Preparing_Data.Rmd".

Source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jbassard/Developing-Data-Products).

## What the app is doing
======================================================================================================================
You can display NOAA's data on a map using the "Plot Data by US State" tab or plot the data as a time serie using "Plot Data by Year" tab.
You can adjust dates range and event types using control panels located on the left side of the App.
The result is shown in the main pannel at the center of the page.
Selected dataset can be downloaded using "Download Selected Data" tab.
